 <p><strong>Enter PAULINA, a Gentleman, and Attendants</strong></p>

 <p><strong>PAULINA</strong><br>
 The keeper of the prison, call to him;<br>
 let him have knowledge who I am.</p>

 <p><em>Exit Gentleman</em></p>

 <p>Good lady,<br>
 No court in Europe is too good for thee;<br>
 What dost thou then in prison?</p>

 <p><em>Re-enter Gentleman, with the Gaoler</em></p>

 <p><strong>PAULINA</strong><br>
 Now, good sir,<br>
 You know me, do you not?</p>

 <section aria-label="Paulina requests access to the Queen">
 <p><strong>Gaoler</strong><br>
 For a worthy lady<br>
 And one whom much I honour.</p>

 <p><strong>PAULINA</strong><br>
 Pray you then,<br>
 Conduct me to the queen.</p>

 <p><strong>Gaoler</strong><br>
 I may not, madam:<br>
 To the contrary I have express commandment.</p>

 <p><strong>PAULINA</strong><br>
 Here's ado,<br>
 To lock up honesty and honour from<br>
 The access of gentle visitors!<br>
 Is't lawful, pray you,<br>
 To see her women? any of them? Emilia?</p>

 <p><strong>Gaoler</strong><br>
 So please you, madam,<br>
 To put apart these your attendants, I<br>
 Shall bring Emilia forth.</p>

 <p><strong>PAULINA</strong><br>
 I pray now, call her.<br>
 Withdraw yourselves.</p>

 <p><em>Exeunt Gentleman and Attendants</em></p>

 <p><strong>Gaoler</strong><br>
 And, madam,<br>
 I must be present at your conference.</p>

 <p><strong>PAULINA</strong><br>
 Well, be't so, prithee.</p>

 <p><em>Exit Gaoler</em></p>

 <section aria-label="Paulina speaks with Emilia about the Queen">
 <p>Here's such ado to make no stain a stain<br>
 As passes colouring.</p>

 <p><em>Re-enter Gaoler, with EMILIA</em></p>

 <p><strong>PAULINA</strong><br>
 Dear gentlewoman,<br>
 How fares our gracious lady?</p>

 <p><strong>EMILIA</strong><br>
 As well as one so great and so forlorn<br>
 May hold together: on her frights and griefs,<br>
 Which never tender lady hath born greater,<br>
 She is something before her time deliver'd.</p>

 <p><strong>PAULINA</strong><br>
 A boy?</p>

 <p><strong>EMILIA</strong><br>
 A daughter, and a goodly babe,<br>
 Lusty and like to live: the queen receives<br>
 Much comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,<br>
 I am innocent as you.'</p>
 </section>

 <section aria-label="Paulina's resolution to confront the King">
 <p><strong>PAULINA</strong><br>
 I dare be sworn<br>
 These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king, beshrew them!<br>
 He must be told on't, and he shall: the office<br>
 Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:<br>
 If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister<br>
 And never to my red-look'd anger be<br>
 The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,<br>
 Commend my best obedience to the queen:<br>
 If she dares trust me with her little babe,<br>
 I'll show't the king and undertake to be<br>
 Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know<br>
 How he may soften at the sight o' the child:<br>
 The silence often of pure innocence<br>
 Persuades when speaking fails.</p>

 <p><strong>EMILIA</strong><br>
 Most worthy madam,<br>
 Your honour and your goodness is so evident<br>
 That your free undertaking cannot miss<br>
 A thriving issue: there is no lady living<br>
 So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship<br>
 To visit the next room, I'll presently<br>
 Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer;<br>
 Who but to-day hammer'd of this design,<br>
 But durst not tempt a minister of honour,<br>
 Lest she should be denied.</p>

 <p><strong>PAULINA</strong><br>
 Tell her, Emilia.<br>
 I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't<br>
 As boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted<br>
 I shall do good.</p>
 </section>

 <section aria-label="Final exchange between Gaoler and Paulina">
 <p><strong>EMILIA</strong><br>
 Now be you blest for it!<br>
 I'll to the queen: please you,<br>
 come something nearer.</p>

 <p><strong>Gaoler</strong><br>
 Madam, if't please the queen to send the babe,<br>
 I know not what I shall incur to pass it,<br>
 Having no warrant.</p>

 <p><strong>PAULINA</strong><br>
 You need not fear it, sir:<br>
 This child was prisoner to the womb and is<br>
 By law and process of great nature thence<br>
 Freed and enfranchised, not a party to<br>
 The anger of the king nor guilty of,<br>
 If any be, the trespass of the queen.</p>

 <p><strong>Gaoler</strong><br>
 I do believe it.</p>

 <p><strong>PAULINA</strong><br>
 Do not you fear: upon mine honour,<br>
 I will stand betwixt you and danger.</p>
