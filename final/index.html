        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p><strong>Process:</strong> This project involved designing a 5x5 grid where each cell toggles its state and the states of its neighbors upon a click. The initial setup ensures the board is random but solvable by simulating random clicks.</p>
        <p><strong>Creative Choices:</strong> I chose a clean and simple design with yellow cells for "on" and black cells for "off." The grid was created dynamically to ensure scalability and maintainability.</p>
        <p><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong> Ensuring the initial board configuration was solvable posed a challenge. This was resolved by toggling cells programmatically during the randomization phase. Additionally, I encountered minor issues with boundary conditions, which were debugged using console logs.</p>
        <p><strong>Insights Gained:</strong> This project deepened my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic. I learned the importance of breaking down complex problems into manageable steps, like isolating cell toggling before building the full game.</p>
